Arduino and python code for DT

Here the Arduino and Python code can de found that represents a DT model prototype for preventive maintenance. 
In combination with an Arduino Microcontroller and current and humity sensors (BMP180 and TA12-100) this DT provides a recommendation when a threshold is triggered.

Further development should be done to increase accuracy
